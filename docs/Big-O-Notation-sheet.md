## Big O Notation

_Big O notation_ is used to classify algorithms according to how their running time or space requirements grow as the input size grows.
On the chart below you may find most common orders of growth of algorithms specified in Big O notation.

Below is the list of some of the most used Big O notations and their performance comparisons against different sizes of the input data.

| Big O Notation | Computations for 10 elements | Computations for 100 elements | Computations for 1000 elements |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **O(1)**       | 1                            | 1                             | 1                              |
| **O(log N)**   | 3                            | 6                             | 9                              |
| **O(N)**       | 10                           | 100                           | 1000                           |
| **O(N log N)** | 30                           | 600                           | 9000                           |
| **O(N^2)**     | 100                          | 10000                         | 1000000                        |
| **O(2^N)**     | 1024                         | 1.26e+29                      | 1.07e+301                      |
| **O(N!)**      | 3628800                      | 9.3e+157                      | 4.02e+2567                     |
